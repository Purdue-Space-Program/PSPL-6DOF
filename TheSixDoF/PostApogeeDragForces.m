% Title: PostApogeeDragForces
% Author: Preston Wright - Created: 8/3/24
% 
% Description: Takes the current specs of the rocket including: altitude, 
% velocity, euler angles, simulation timestamp, and main chute deployment
% time to calculate the vertical and lateral drag forces produced by the 
% drogue and main parachutes when applicable for each.
%
% Inputs: alt - current altitude of the rocket            [1x3 vector - m]
%         vel - current velocity of the rocket          [1x3 vector - m/s]
%         angle - current euler angles of the rocket    [1x3 vector - rad]
%         time - current time the simulation is at                     [s]
%         rho - current air density                               [kg/m^3]
%         mainChuteTime - time of simulation main chute opens          [s]
%         output - 0 to turn off recovery, 1 to turn on
%
% Outputs: paraForceBody - parachute drag force in the body frame      [N]
%          mainChuteTime - time of simulation main chute opens: this
%                          variable is zero until it takes a value     [s]

%% Parachute Drag Force Calculations

% Ensures drag from the parachutes is implemented only after the rocket has
% reached apogee, and that the correct parachutes are deployed at the
% correct altitudes. 
    
% Drogue deployment only

    totDia = drogueDia;
    totCd = drogueCd;
    mainChuteTime = 0;

% Main deployment
elseif alt(1) > 0

    % Initialize time main chute deploys at with respect to the
    % simulation
    if mainChuteTime == 0
        mainChuteTime = time;
        totDia = drogueDia;
        totCd = drogueCd;

    % Linearlly interpolate through the main chute deployment (this
    % will likely be improved later)
    elseif time - mainChuteTime <= mainDeployTime
        totDia = drogueDia + mainDia * (time - mainChuteTime)

    % adding diameters were sufficient for surface area calculations and
    % the inflated parachute is a perfect semisphere aside from vertical
    % deformation
