%
% Description: This function takes the omega vector in the body frame and
% the current quat vector and outputs the quat rotation rates
%
% Note: Professor Fr√ºh's notes from AAE 590 go through
% these steps in more detail
%
% Inputs: 
% omegaVector = array of the angular velocity in the body frame [rad/s]
% angleVector = array of the current quat
%
% Outputs:
% quatRates = the euler rate time derivative in the inertial frame
